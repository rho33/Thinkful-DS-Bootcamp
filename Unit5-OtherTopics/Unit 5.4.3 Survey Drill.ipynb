    "# DRILL: When to use surveys \n",
    "State whether a survey would be the best option for answering each of the following questions.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Popularity of various Uber drivers. \n",
    "     - Yes. Uber already does this with their star rating after each ride. That's a single question survey.\n",
    " 2. A grocery store wants to know how much people like strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla ice cream. \n",
    "     - No. Use the purchase data.\n",
    " 3. Trojan wants to know whether their condoms are more popular among straight people or gay people. \n",
    "     - Unsure. Gay people are less likely to answer a sexual orientation question than straight people, but I can't think of a better alternative. The survey may just have to be more carefully designed and distributed (preselected survey panels).\n",
    " 4. Recently, rental rates for HappyCars have increased by 30%, which is quite unusual. You want to find out why this is happening and how to keep the increase going.\n",
    "     - Yes.\n",
    " 5. Assessing the success rate of a new advertising campaign.\n",
    "     - No. The actual sales data (e.g. a/b testing) would be best. A survey may be helpful supplemental information \n",
    " 6. Measuring the effect of nurse/patient ratio on patient recovery rates in hospital wards.\n",
    "     - No. Use the actual recovery rate data."
