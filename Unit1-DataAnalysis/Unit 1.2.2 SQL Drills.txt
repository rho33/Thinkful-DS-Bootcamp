Drills 1.2.2 SQL 

Let's confirm some of this new knowledge with a few basic exercises. Write SQL queries to return:

1. The ID's and durations for all trips of duration greater than 500, ordered by duration.

SELECT
	trip_id,
	duration
FROM
	trips
WHERE
	duration > 500
ORDER BY duration desc

2. Every column of the stations table for station id 84.

SELECT
	*
FROM
	stations
WHERE
	station_id = 84

3. The min temperatures of all the occurrences of rain in zip 94301

SELECT
	Date,
	MinTemperatureF,
	Events
FROM
	weather
WHERE
	ZIP = 94301
	AND
	Events LIKE  '%Rain%'
