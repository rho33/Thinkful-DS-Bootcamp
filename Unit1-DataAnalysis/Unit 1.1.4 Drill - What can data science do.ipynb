From the cost and price information, you would want to identify the margin on each product. Then, using your data on individual visitors' sessions, you would need to estimate how effective each ad campaign would be at increasing sales of the products. Assuming you have already advertised for each of the three products on the site before, you could split users up into groups based on what products had been advertised to them and compare conversion rates. With both the product margin and the change in conversion rates, you should be able to estimate which ad will result in the largest profit increase. "

Additionally you could look for any change in the ratio of complete sign ups to incomplete sign ups, as well as exploring how changes in marketing spend affect the ratio of complete sign ups to incomplete sign ups."
