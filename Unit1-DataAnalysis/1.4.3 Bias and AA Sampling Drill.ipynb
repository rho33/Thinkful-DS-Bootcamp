More people (in the northern hemisphere) will likely buy bathing suits in May than in February independent of the email version they receive. Sending both email versions during the same time period (randomizing who gets which version) should fix this problem."

The relevant question is whether or not the clinic helps reduce the anxiety of its patients, not whether the anxiety of its patients is lower than the general population.
