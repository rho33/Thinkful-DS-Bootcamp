    "#### You are on a game show and given the choice of whatever is behind three doors. Behind one door is a fantastic prize (some examples use a car, others use cash) while behind the other two doors is a dud (some examples say a goat, others say it's just empty). You pick a door. Then the host opens one of the other two doors to reveal a dud. But here's the wrinkle: the host now gives you the opportunity to switch your door. What should you do?"

    "You should switch doors. The host presumably knows what is behind each door and will always reveal a dud after you initially pick a door. This means that when you initially pick the correct door, the host will open either of the other two doors and when you switch you will lose. When you initially pick the wrong door, the host will always open the other wrong door and when you switch you will win. Since you initially pick the correct door 33.3% and a wrong door 66.7% of the time, switching will result in you winning 66.7% of the time while not switching will result in you winning only 33.3% of the time."
